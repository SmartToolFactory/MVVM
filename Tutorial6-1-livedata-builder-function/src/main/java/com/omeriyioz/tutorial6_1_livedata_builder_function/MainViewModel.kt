/*
* The following two different approaches does the same thing.
*
*
* üî• livedata builder function :
* The code block starts executing when LiveData becomes active and is automatically canceled after a configurable timeout when the LiveData becomes inactive.
* If it is canceled before completion, it is restarted if the LiveData becomes active again. If it completed successfully in a previous run, it doesn't restart.
* Note that it is restarted only if canceled automatically. If the block is canceled for any other reason (e.g. throwing a CancelationException), it is not restarted.
* https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#livedata
*
* üëç liveData builder is invoked when the observer is active.
* üëé If you want to invoke liveData when a button is clicked, then livedata builder function is not suitable for this case.
